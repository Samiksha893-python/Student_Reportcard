#  Student Report Card Project

## Overview
The **Student Report Card Project** is a Python-based application created in **Jupyter Notebook** to simplify the process of managing and analyzing student performance.  
This project allows teachers and schools to input marks for students in various subjects, calculate their total score, percentage, and grade, and generate a structured report card.  
It is a beginner-friendly yet powerful project that demonstrates the use of Python fundamentals and data analysis libraries.

## Description
Education systems require effective tools to evaluate student performance. Traditionally, report card preparation is time-consuming and prone to errors.  
This project solves that issue by offering a simple Python solution to automatically generate report cards.  

The system accepts marks of multiple subjects for different students and performs the following tasks:  
- Calculates **total marks** obtained.  
- Computes the **percentage**.  
- Assigns grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on predefined criteria.  
- Displays results in an easy-to-read tabular format.  
- Optionally provides graphs and insights using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**.  

The project uses Python’s powerful libraries like **Pandas** and **NumPy** to handle data efficiently. It can be extended to include features such as exporting report cards in PDF/Excel, integrating with a database, or building a student login system.  

This project is useful for:  
- **Students** → to track their performance.  
- **Teachers** → to automate the grading process.  
- **Institutions** → to handle large-scale evaluation quickly.  

By building this project, students learn about Python programming, data handling, visualization, and problem-solving — making it a great beginner-to-intermediate level project in data analysis and automation.
## Features
- Input marks for multiple students.  
- Automatic calculation of **Total, Percentage, Grade**.  
- Display results in a clean **table format**.  
- Support for **data visualization** (charts, graphs).  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to modify.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (data analysis)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (visualization)
